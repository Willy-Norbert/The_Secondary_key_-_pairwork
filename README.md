The analysis aims to demonstrate the application of SQL window functions in performing various analytical tasks.

## Objectives
- Work with SQL window functions on a generic dataset.
- Perform various analytical queries using `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and aggregate functions.
- Explain their queries, results, and real-life applications of window functions.
- Document their work properly and push everything to GitHub.
